## Surface

#### Fonts

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat) - Primary Font
- [Lobster](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster?query=lob) - Secondary Font
- [Baloo Chetten 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Chettan+2?query=Baloo) - Supplementary Font

The primary font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat">Montserrat</a> is in the body of all pages. I chose it because of its readability and accessibility. It complements the secondary font.
The Secondary is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lobster?query=lob">Lobster</a> is in the Heading and buttons, it is a big font with a very open face, has good readability and fits the look we wanted.
The supplementary font <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Baloo+Chettan+2?query=Baloo">Baloo Chetten 2</a> is the clients logo font.
The backup font "Sans-Serif" is the most popular backup in case there is a loading issue the web page always has a font.

#### Colour Scheme

- ![#e9d9ca](https://placehold.it/15/e9d9ca/000000?text=+) `rgb(233, 217, 202)` - Primary-(Jumbo)
- ![#72080b](https://placehold.it/15/72080b/000000?text=+) `rbg(114, 8, 11)` - Secondary (Header and Footer)
- ![#ba9d81](https://placehold.it/15/ba9d81/000000?text=+) `rgb(186, 157, 129)` - Supplementary colour 1
- ![#5c493e](https://placehold.it/15/5c493e/000000?text=+) `rgb(92, 73, 62)` - Supplementary colour 2
- ![#bdac52](https://placehold.it/15/bdac52/000000?text=+) `rgb(189, 172, 82)` - Supplementary colour 3

The Colour scheme has earthy natural colours. The supplementary colours ![#ba9d81](https://placehold.it/15/ba9d81/000000?text=+) ![#5c493e](https://placehold.it/15/5c493e/000000?text=+) ![#bdac52](https://placehold.it/15/bdac52/000000?text=+) are a mix of colours used in the background image that is throughout. The secondary colour ![#72080b](https://placehold.it/15/72080b/000000?text=+) is used for the Header/Navigation and the footer, the colour itself is from a picture of wooden floorboards that have had a deep red varnish and the picture was colour saturated and contrast sharpened to give it a look we were after.
Primary colour ![#e9d9ca](https://placehold.it/15/e9d9ca/000000?text=+) is a soft neutral colour. It contrasts nicely with the text and is used as a background colour.

#### Images

Images are used extensively. The pictures we chose created the colour theme and worked well together.

The background image is a country kitchen. We added a light filter to it, so it would not take away from the main content of the page.

## Features
 
- **Registration:**
  Anyone can register to use Chow. Email, username and password are required.
 
- **Password Encryption:**
  Users passwords are secure as they are not stored in the database, We use a Python library called [Bcrypt](https://bcrypt-generator.com/) to encrypt the password. We store only the encrypted password. Even if the database gets hacked, the password can not be stolen.
 
- **No Duplicate users:**
  We use the email address to check users' login, as emails by nature are unique.
 
- **Dynamic login/logout menu items:**
  In the navigation header and footer the menu item login and logout changes dynamically if a user is logged in, or out.
 
- **Footer login:**
  There is a handy login section in the footer. That is also dynamically hidden if the user is logged in.
 
- **User Only CRUD:**
 
  - Only a logged-in user may upload a new recipe.
 
  - Only the user that has uploaded the recipe may edit or delete it, and this is done by:
 
    - Checking to see if the logged in username is the same as the username that is added to the recipe when uploaded.
    - Hiding the 'Delete' and 'Edit' button if the usernames don't match.
 
- **Category Select Button:**
  Lets the user narrow down the list of recipes to browse from.
 
- **Search Bar:**
  We implemented the search bar to help users pinpoint a recipe they are looking for. The search bar searches for a word or a sentence in the name of the recipe. If there are multiple results, a list of all results are shone.
 
### Future Features
 
- **A user profile page:** A profile section for the users.
- **A star rating system:** To be able to sort the recipes from best down.
- **A comments section in the recipes:** A comment section to leave advice or ideas to future users.
- **A users favourite section:** To tag a recipe as favourite so the users may keep a list of all the recipes they enjoyed the most, to keep in their profile.
- **A cloud-based image library:** The user may upload their own images. That gets stored in the cloud-based library. That optimizes the images and will speed up the loading time.

## Testing
 
- The first phase of testing is a step by step basis. As I implemented a new code, I would run the app on my localhost with the debugger on. If any of the Flask routes did not work, the debugger would catch them.
 
- If the routes are loaded, I tested them on Chrome and Firefox Developer Tools.
 
- I tested HTML with W3 Validator. I got an illegal character from [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) templates. They are acceptable errors as Flask needs the templates to connect throughout the site.
 
- I tested CSS with W3 CSS Validator. I only got errors with CSS Variables. The reason I use variables in the `:root`, is if the client needs to change a 'Font' or a 'Background colour', We only have to change it in one place, the `:root`, that changes it everywhere on the site.
- These errors are an ongoing issue with W3, They are valid, but not recognised by W3. '[CSS variables ("custom properties"), a widely supported and crucial feature.CSS-Validator issues 111](https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111)'
 
- After the [jQuery](https://code.jquery.com/) was completed, I ran through the code to make sure it was working.
 
- I tested all the links to make sure they worked as intended.
 
- I tested the CRUD capabilities to make sure they all worked.
 
- I tested the registration and login route.
 
- I tested the 'Contact Us' link to ensure the correct email and subject are preloaded into the user email client.
 
- I tested the forms for form validation, making sure it displayed the Error message if input fields do not meet criteria.
 
- I sent it to the Slack community for feedback.
 
- I ran the application through [Website Responsive Testing](https://responsivetesttool.com) to make sure it is responsive. Below is a list of devices:

## Bugs 
 
**Being able to login with a different username.**
On registration the username/email and password get logged to the database. When the user logged in again, only the email was checked for duplicates. The problem was the user could login with the right email and password but wrong username.
Upon adding a new recipe, the recipes get tagged with the username from `Sessions`, which means if the user logged in with a different username but correct email and password, they get logged in but not able edit/delete their recipe.
My first fix was to add the username input on the login page and have the username from the form checked with the username from the database. But this adds another input and is not good UX.
 
> To fix this issue, The user only inputs the username once at registration. At login, once the email and passwords get checked, The `Sessions` is created using the stored username. taking away the need for a username input when logging in.
 
```python
login_user = users.find_one({'email': request.form['userEmail']})
session['username'] = login_user['name']
session['logged_in'] = True
 
```
 
**Case Sensitivity**
In my testing, I found that users are using capital letters when entering their email addresses, this causes an issue if we need to use their emails later on.
 
> I used the `.lower()` method to keep all email in lower case
 
**Search Bar Case Sensitivity**
I had a bug with the search bar not being able to pick out the words in a search, because `$regex` looks for identical matchmaking it case sensitive.
 
> My fix was to add the optional `$options` to the query, using the `'i'` makes it case-insensitive.
 
```python
recipes = list(mongo.db.recipes.find({
        "recipe_name": {"$regex": f'.*{search_text}.*', '$options': 'i'}}))
 
```
 
**Category Drop-Down Menu**
I had an issue with using hyperlink tags `<a>` in the category drop-down menu because they use `href`. The only way to get the chosen link into [Flask](https://flask-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is with [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/) `{{url_for}}` and can not pass through a `value` for each item. Hyperlink tags do not support the `value` attribute. I would have to take a different route for every category listed. I also wanted to include 'Chefs and Servings' as catagories into the drop-down menu. Giving the user additional  sorting options.
 
> I decided to go with a form. The drop-down menu with the `select` and `options` uses a button and makes a `"POST"` request. This way I would only need 3 routes: one for the category, one for 'Chefs', and one for Servings.
> To check if Chefs and Servings are selected or not. I used an `if` statement to select the right route. The `else` of the statement would go to the category's route.
 
```python
if cat_search == "chef":
   return redirect('chef')
elif cat_search == "servings":
   return redirect('servings')
else:
 
```
 
**Rendering HTML tags instead of plain text**
The issue I had with using the [CKEditor](https://ckeditor.com/) is that it uses HTML to keep the structure of what you have typed. When recalling the edited text back to be displayed. It was rendering the HTML with tags and not plain text.
 
> My fix was to use the {{  |safe }} in the Jinja2 template.

## Deployment
 
I hosted this site using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
 
Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS). I used it because it's free, elegant, flexible, and easy to use, offering developers the simplest path to getting my app up.

### To deploy on Heroku

The Heroku CLI requires Git, the popular version control system. If you don’t already have Git installed, complete the following before proceeding

- [Git installation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
