Feature:
Index - Checks to see if the user is anomymous or a login in  user. If the user is anomymous, we offer the join up botton, If the use has a login but not subcribed to the programs, we use the subscribe botton, If the user is a "Pro" user, we offer the programs tab.


 Bugs:
 after adding a check to see if user is the same as the author, as to let the author edir or update post I have noticed the comments messages is chnaging as to how is logged it.
